A plugin for integrating Tainacan plugin pages with the amazing Blocksy theme.

[Blocksy](https://creativethemes.com/blocksy/) is one of the many WordPress themes available out there. But it is not just another theme, it offers rich controls to customize your site with so many features that you won't miss a page builder. This project uses their customizer controls to offer options for setting different layouts to Tainacan pages such as the collection items list and the items page.
